        "description": "Media portrayal shapes public perception. If a demographic is mostly shown in crime reports, people may associate them with crime. Our study on indigenous communities in Bangladesh reveals a bias: news highlights crime and culture but neglects critical issues like health, economy, and education. This selective coverage keeps their struggles invisible to the broader population.",

Temporal reasoning is a key aspect of human intelligence that enables individuals to solve puzzles, conduct crime investigations, analyze detective cases, and engage in creative storytelling. Our study evaluates LLMs' temporal reasoning ability by prompting them to perform tasks that require such reasoning, leveraging the VoT prompting technique to enhance their performance and interpretability.",
